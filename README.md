## Commit Tags
It is useful to use specific tags for each commit, so that the message is as descriptive as possible.
- `feat`: to indicate the inclusion of a new feature.
- `chore`: boring stuff like deleting useless files.
- `refactor`: when you change file names or functions to organize the project better.
- `docs`: when you include new documentation in your project.
- `data`: when you include or change data in your project.
